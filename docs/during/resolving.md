A business incident resolves after its parent severe technical incident has been resolved. Go through the Message Creation Loop to create a resolution message.

After the resolution message has been approved and distributed, the Business Lead should instruct responders to complete the following actions.

1. Instruct the Social Officer to resume all regularly scheduled social activities. The Social Officer will notify the Business Lead when all social activities are resumed.
1. Instruct the Marketing Officer to resume all regularly scheduled marketing activities. The Growth Officer will notify the Comms Lead when all marketing activities are resumed.
1. Instruct the Technical SLT to prepare a Preliminary Analysis that should be ready within 24 hours.
1. Ensure all actions and owners have been documented via chat. Transcribe any additional actions/notes as necessary.
1. End the Business Incident call and resolve the business incident.
